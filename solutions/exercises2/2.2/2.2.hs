{-

    In this exercise we try to infer the types of the functions in the WhatType.hs file.

    f0
    - (Char, Char) -> Bool

    f1
    - [Char] -> [Char]

    f2
    - a -> (b, c) -> (c, a, b)

    f3
    - Char -> Char

    f4
    - Because of the outcome of f1 i would think: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char], but it is: String -> String -> String

    f5
    - Bool -> a -> a -> (a, a)
    - How does Haskell know x and y are of the same type?

    f6
    -- p1 -> p2 -> p1
    -- Dont really now how this one works yet

    -f7
    -- [Char] -> [Char]
    -- This one neither
